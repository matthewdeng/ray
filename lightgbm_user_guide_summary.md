- **Checkpointing**: Model persistence and fault tolerance
- **Results Access**: How to access training results and load models
- **Batch Inference**: Distributed inference with trained models

### 2. Code Examples
**File**: `doc/source/train/doc_code/lightgbm_quickstart.py`

Side-by-side comparison showing:
- Traditional LightGBM training
- LightGBM with Ray Train distributed training
- Proper data loading and preprocessing
- Resource configuration and scaling

### 3. Comprehensive Examples
**File**: `doc/source/train/examples/lightgbm/README.md`

Extensive examples covering:
- **Binary Classification**: Complete breast cancer dataset example
- **Multi-class Classification**: Iris dataset example
